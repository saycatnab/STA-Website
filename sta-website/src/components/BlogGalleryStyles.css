/* grid template areas not working, 
after so many videos showing how easy it is to make a image collage and tim wasted, 
the problem was that on Inspect, it showed the grid-area in each of the images are not working. And it says its to do with a parent element having display:block and should change it to display:grid.
which is bs becuase theres nothing in this css file in this component that has display block.
the herosection and navbar hane display flex only and im not going to change them. */
